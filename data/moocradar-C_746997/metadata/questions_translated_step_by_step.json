The overall gain is 11, so uo = 11 * 0.1V = 1.1V.\n\nWhen resistor R2 is open, the feedback loop for A1 is broken, causing the output of A1 to saturate at the positive supply limit. However, the second stage (A2) still operates, so the output voltage remains 1.1V.\n\nWhen resistor R3 is open, the input to A2 from A1 is disconnected, making the output of A2 equal to the input voltage, which is 0.1V.\n\nWhen resistor R4 is open, the feedback loop for A2 is broken, but the first stage (A1) still operates normally. The output of A1 is 1.1V, which becomes the input to A2. Since R4 is open, the output of A2 is also 1.1V.\n\nWhen resistor R4 is shorted, the feedback loop for A2 is effectively a direct connection, making the gain of A2 equal to 1. The output of A1 is 1.1V, which is passed through A2 without any additional gain, so the output voltage remains 1.1V.\n\nWhen resistor R5 is shorted, the negative input of A2 is directly connected to the output, forcing the output to 0V due to the virtual ground concept.\n\nWhen resistor R5 is open, the negative input of A2 is disconnected from the feedback path, causing the output of A2 to saturate at the positive supply limit, which is 14V."
